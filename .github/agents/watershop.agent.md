  ## MCP Configuration

  This repo includes a workspace MCP config at `.mcp.json`.

  - Check `.mcp.json` before MCP-backed work so the active server list stays in sync with the repo.
  - The current configured MCP servers are `github` and `digitalocean`.
  - Use the GitHub server for repository, issue, pull request, and workflow context when MCP access is available.
  - Use the DigitalOcean server for infrastructure and deployment context when MCP access is available.
  - Treat every value in `.mcp.json`, especially environment variables and tokens, as a secret: never echo them back to the user, commit them, or copy them into logs, docs, code, or patches.
  - If `.mcp.json` changes, update this agent file so the MCP guidance stays accurate.

## CRITICAL: Implementation Workflow

**When the user requests a change, bug fix, or feature:**

1. **Analyze** the request and gather necessary context (read files, search codebase, check errors)
    - If the task could benefit from external GitHub or DigitalOcean context, inspect `.mcp.json` first and use the configured MCP server instead of guessing external state.
2. **Present a clear plan** listing:
   - What files will be modified
   - What changes will be made to each file
   - What commands will be run (if any)
   - Expected outcome
3. **Ask for confirmation**: "Would you like me to proceed with these changes? (yes/no)"
4. **After receiving YES**: Immediately implement ALL changes using the appropriate tools:
   - Use `replace_string_in_file` or `multi_replace_string_in_file` for code edits
   - Use `run_in_terminal` for commands
   - Never just describe what should be done — actually do it
5. **Verify**: Check for errors after implementation and confirm completion
6. **Update this agent file** (`watershop.agent.md`) to reflect any new findings:
   - Mark completed priorities in the Outstanding Action Plan (e.g. ~~Priority 2~~)
   - Add newly discovered bugs to the Known Bugs table
   - Remove bugs from the Known Bugs table once they are fixed
   - Update Environment Variable statuses if they changed
   - Update any data model fields that were added or changed
   - Keep the action plan and bug list accurate so future sessions start with correct context

**NEVER:**
- Suggest changes without offering to implement them
- Describe what "should be done" without actually doing it after confirmation
- Skip the confirmation step for non-trivial changes
- Stop halfway through implementation

## NestJS Module Conventions

Every feature follows this exact file structure — always replicate it:

```
src/<feature>/
  <feature>.module.ts      ← imports Mongoose model, provides service
  <feature>.controller.ts  ← HTTP routes, @ApiTags, @ApiOperation
  <feature>.service.ts     ← business logic, injected dependencies
  dto/
    create-<feature>.dto.ts
    update-<feature>.dto.ts
  entities/
    <feature>.entity.ts    ← Mongoose @Schema + @Prop definitions
```

### Service injection pattern
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class ExampleService {
  constructor(
    @InjectModel(Example.name) private exampleModel: Model<ExampleDocument>,
    private realtimeService: RealtimeService,  // always inject for mutations
  ) {}
}
```

### Realtime rule — ALWAYS call this after any mutation:
```typescript
this.realtimeService.emitDashboardUpdate("feature.eventName");
// e.g. "orders.created", "inventory.updated", "notifications.resolved"
```

### Swagger decoration — every controller method must have:
```typescript
@ApiTags("Feature Name")    // on the class
@ApiOperation({ summary: "..." })  // on each method
```

## Authentication Architecture ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

**Current state:** Global `JwtAuthGuard` is registered via `APP_GUARD` in `app.module.ts`. All routes require a valid Bearer JWT by default.

**Files implemented:**
- `src/auth/jwt.strategy.ts` — PassportStrategy reading `process.env.JWT_SECRET`
- `src/auth/jwt-auth.guard.ts` — extends `AuthGuard('jwt')`, checks `@Public()` metadata
- `src/auth/public.decorator.ts` — `SetMetadata(IS_PUBLIC_KEY, true)`
- `src/auth/auth.module.ts` — `@Global()` module, registers `PassportModule` + `JwtStrategy`

Routes decorated with `@Public()` (no JWT required):
- `POST /users/register`
- `POST /users/login`
- `POST /refills` (kiosk users are not logged-in)
- `GET /health` (health probe)

Rate limiting also applied globally via `ThrottlerGuard` (10 req / 60s per IP).

## Known Bugs — Never Reintroduce These

### � High
| # | Location | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| H3 | `dashboard/page.tsx` | KPI card title still says `"Rental Orders"` — should be `"Delivery Orders"` (logic already uses `o.isDelivery`, just the label is wrong) |

### 🟡 Medium
| # | Location | Issue |
|---|---|---|
| M1 | `order.entity.ts` | `paymentDetails: any` — define a typed `PaymentDetails` discriminated union |
| M2 | `customers.service.ts` | `findByPhone` uses unindexed regex scan — add index on `phone` field |
| M5 | `deliveries.service.ts` | `findAll` fetches ALL deliveries — add pagination (same pattern as orders) |
| M6 | `refills.service.ts` | Unsafe `(customer as any)?._id` cast throughout the service |
| M7 | `frontend_public/contact_mail.php`, `frontend_public/enquiry_mail.php`, `frontend_public/contact_process.php` | Public-site email delivery still relies on raw `mail()` from PHP handlers — move to a supported server-side mail path before public launch |
| M8 | `frontend_public/index.html`, `frontend_public/contact.html` | Public-site forms post to PHP AJAX handlers, so the site cannot be moved into `frontend/` without rewriting the form backend |

## Outstanding Action Plan

Work through these in order. Run `npm test` after each group.

**For each priority:** Present the specific changes needed, ask for confirmation, then implement immediately upon receiving "yes".

### ~~Priority 2 — Backend Auth Guards~~ ✅ DONE
All auth files created, `APP_GUARD` registered. `@Public()` on register, login, `POST /refills`, `GET /health`.

### ~~Priority 3 — Fix orderNumber Collision~~ ✅ DONE
`randomBytes(4).toString("hex").toUpperCase()` used in `orders.service.ts`.

### ~~Priority 4 — Notifications Resolve Endpoint~~ ✅ DONE
`PATCH /:id/resolve` and `PATCH /resolve-all` implemented in controller and service.

### Priority 5 — Fix "Rental Orders" Label in Dashboard
In `app/dashboard/page.tsx` — the filter logic already uses `o.isDelivery === true` ✅, but the KPI card title still reads `"Rental Orders"`. Change it to `"Delivery Orders"`.

### ~~Priority 6 — Rate Limiting~~ ✅ DONE
`ThrottlerModule` + `ThrottlerGuard` registered globally in `app.module.ts`.

### ~~Priority 7 — MongoDB Transactions in OrdersService~~ ✅ DONE
Uses `@InjectConnection()` + `session.withTransaction()` with graceful fallback for standalone MongoDB.

### ~~Priority 8 — Pagination for GET /orders~~ ✅ DONE
`findAll(year?, page=1, limit=50)` returns `{ data, pagination: { total, page, limit, totalPages, hasPrev, hasNext } }`.

### ~~Priority 9 — .env.example files~~ ✅ DONE
Both `backend/.env.example` and `frontend/.env.example` exist. `.env` and `.env.local` are in `.gitignore`.

### ~~Priority 10 — Health Check Endpoint~~ ✅ DONE
`src/health.controller.ts` with `@Public() @HealthCheck()`, using `MongooseHealthIndicator`. `TerminusModule` registered in `app.module.ts`.

### Priority 11 — Fix Deliveries Pagination (Bug M5)
Same pattern as orders — add `page` and `limit` params to `deliveries.service.ts:findAll()`.

### Priority 12 — Fix Refills Unsafe Cast (Bug M6)
Replace `(customer as any)?._id` with proper typed access in `refills.service.ts`.

### ~~Priority 13 — Promotions Feature~~ ✅ DONE
Full backend module (`backend/src/promotions/`) + frontend admin page (`app/dashboard/promotions/page.tsx`) + Sidebar nav item (admin-only, Tag icon, after Customers) + "Current Promotion!" gold banner in `add-product-modal.tsx` + promotions fetch in `orders/new/page.tsx`.

### Priority 14 — Public Website Deployment Strategy
For fastest launch, deploy `frontend_public/` as a separate public DigitalOcean app/site and keep the existing Next.js app for dashboard and kiosk flows. If the goal is a single codebase, migrate the site intentionally into `frontend/` instead of copying raw HTML and PHP into the Next app.

### Priority 15 — Replace Public Website PHP Forms and Raw Mail
Local env-file support now exists for `frontend_public/`, but `contact_mail.php`, `enquiry_mail.php`, and `contact_process.php` still need to move to a supported server-side path (Next.js route handlers, backend endpoints, or another mail integration). Configure reCAPTCHA/mail settings in deployment environment variables before public launch.

### ~~Priority 16 — Confirm Woodstock Domain Spelling Before DNS Cutover~~ ✅ DONE
DigitalOcean App Platform custom domains now use `woodstockswatershop.com`, `employee.woodstockswatershop.com`, and `api.woodstockswatershop.com`. Rebel authoritative DNS now returns only the intended apex records. The remaining public-site blocker is propagation: some public resolvers still cache the removed apex A record and `woodstockswatershop.com` is not yet serving valid HTTPS everywhere.

---

## Frontend Patterns

### API calls
Always use `lib/api.ts` (the configured Axios instance with JWT interceptor), never raw `fetch` or a new `axios.create()`.

```typescript
import api from "@/lib/api";
const { data } = await api.get("/customers");
```

### Server Actions (auth only)
Auth operations in `features/auth/actions.ts` use Next.js Server Actions (`"use server"`). All other data operations use the Axios `api` client from the browser.

### Route protection
`proxy.ts` (Next.js middleware) guards `/dashboard/**` by checking the `session_token` HttpOnly cookie. Do not add additional redirect logic in page components — let the middleware handle it.

### Public marketing site (`frontend_public`)
`frontend/` is the authenticated Next.js app for dashboard and kiosk flows. Its root currently redirects `/` to `/login`, while `proxy.ts` only protects `/dashboard`, `/login`, and `/signup`.

`frontend_public/` is a separate legacy public website surface for internet traffic. It is not part of the Next.js build and currently uses static HTML, jQuery AJAX form submissions, downloadable manuals, and PHP mail handlers.

The public-site "Employee" navigation links now point to `https://employee.woodstockswatershop.com/dashboard` rather than the raw DigitalOcean app hostname.

Do not treat `frontend_public/` as a drop-in folder for `frontend/`. Moving it into the Next.js app requires converting the HTML pages to App Router routes and replacing the PHP form handlers with Next.js route handlers or backend endpoints.

For fastest launch, a separate DigitalOcean app/site is the simplest choice. For long-term maintainability, migrate the public site into `frontend/` intentionally instead of hosting two unrelated frontend stacks forever.

If split, prefer the public site on the root domain or `www` and the authenticated Next.js app on an `app` subdomain.

### Realtime hook
```typescript
import { useDashboardRealtime } from "@/lib/use-dashboard-realtime";
useDashboardRealtime({ onUpdate: () => refetchData() });
```

### Cookie names
| Cookie | Readable by | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `session_token` | HttpOnly (server only) | Guards middleware route checks |
| `auth_token_public` | JS-readable | Attached as `Authorization: Bearer` by Axios interceptor |
| `user_info` | JS-readable | Stores `{ id, name, role }` for UI display |

---

## Testing Conventions

- Test files: `<service>.service.spec.ts` co-located with the service
- All dependencies are mocked — no real MongoDB connection
- Use the existing patterns in `customers.service.spec.ts` and `orders.service.spec.ts` as templates

Run tests:
```bash
cd backend
npm test                    # all unit tests
npm test -- --watch         # watch mode
npm test -- --coverage      # coverage report
```

After every backend change, run `npm test` and confirm all tests pass before considering the task done.

| `VALKEY_HOST/PORT/PASSWORD/TLS` | API | ✅ Set |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` | UI | ✅ Set in production on the DigitalOcean employee app |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CUSTOM_APP_HOST` | UI | 🟡 Optional. Added to `frontend/.env.example` and set on the DigitalOcean employee app for custom-domain cutover logic |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_CUSTOM_API_URL` | UI | 🟡 Optional. Added to `frontend/.env.example` and set on the DigitalOcean employee app for custom-domain cutover logic |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_RECAPTCHA_SECRET` | Public site server handler | 🟡 Loaded from `frontend_public/.env.development` locally — set as a deployment environment variable before public launch |
| `PUBLIC_SITE_CONTACT_EMAIL` | Public site server handler | 🟡 Loaded from `frontend_public/.env.development` locally — set as a deployment environment variable before public launch |

## Rules to Always Follow

1. **Plan-first workflow** — Present plan → Ask confirmation → Implement changes immediately after "yes"
2. **Never hardcode secrets** — always use `process.env.VAR_NAME`
3. **Always emit realtime after mutations** — `this.realtimeService.emitDashboardUpdate("reason")`
4. **Always add `@ApiOperation`** to every new controller method
5. **Mark public routes** with `@Public()` once the auth guard is in place
6. **Use `NotFoundException`** when a `findById` returns null
7. **Soft-delete only** for Inventory and Suppliers — set `isActive: false`, never delete the document
8. **Run `npm test` after every backend change** — the suite must stay green
9. **Never fetch all records** — paginate `findAll` methods that could grow large (`orders`, `deliveries`)
10. **Use `lib/api.ts`** for all frontend HTTP calls — never bypass the interceptor
11. **Kiosk routes are public** — `POST /refills` must not require a JWT
12. **Implement, don't just suggest** — After confirmation, use file edit tools and terminal commands to actually make the changes
13. **Keep this file current** — After every completed implementation, update `watershop.agent.md`: strike through finished priorities, add/remove bugs, update model fields or env var statuses as needed
14. **Treat `frontend_public/` as internet-facing** — avoid dashboard-only assumptions, and do not apply the Next.js/TanStack Query conventions there unless it has been migrated into `frontend/`
15. **Treat moving `frontend_public/` into `frontend/` as a migration** — convert HTML pages to App Router routes and replace PHP handlers before considering the move complete
16. **DigitalOcean deploys directly from GitHub** — the current App Platform apps use GitHub source with `deploy_on_push: true`, so do not assume GitHub Actions are part of the deployment path unless they are intentionally reintroduced
